    <h1>A little bit About Me</h1>
    <p>Born in Schweinfurt, Germany so I'm a military baby. My main interests are music, cars and technology</p>


    <h2>My History</h2>
    <p>I've been in Arizona for the past 3 years after moving from Atlanta, Ga where I grew up at. I went to school at Tuskegee University and DeVry University but got no degree since my mind was set on music whether it be producing or mixing.</p>
    
    <h3>My Life Today</h3>
    <p>Now I'm attempting to learn web development and besides the 100 degree weather, Arizona is great for the people and its growing technology industry that I want to be apart of. Attempting to juggle work and school is a challenge but in the end to be able to develop for the things that interest me is what keeps me on track for success. e</p>
